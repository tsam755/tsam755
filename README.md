# Kia ora, I'm Taha üëã

A Business Analyst with an Accounting & Finance background who crossed over into data because real-world decisions need more than just gut feeling and spreadsheets.... (I still love Excel)

Now I build ML models, automate workflows, and answer the **‚Äúso what?‚Äù** behind every analysis.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª What I Do:
- Translate ambiguous business pain points into structured, solvable problems
- Take my time understanding the data. Even business do not expect what analysts uncover
- Help you understand why I am happy with an AUC of 80%
